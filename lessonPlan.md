The basics:

* **Goal**: SWBAT Use JavaScript to write data to a file
* **Timing**: Approximately 30 minutes.

**Implementation notes:**

This project can be studied independently or used as a demonstration for a whole class. The notes have quite a lot of detail and rely on pupils being familiar with:
- HTML
- Hypertext links
- JavaScript that is run when a page loads
- Javascript variables and arrays
- The use of 'getElementByID' and how attributes of HTML elements can be modifed by JavaScript.

The project ends with a few activites for the pupils to explore.
